      Unexpected downtime is more than an inconvenience—it’s a direct hit to your bottom line. According to Gartner, the average cost of IT downtime is $5,600 per minute, adding up to over $300,000 per hour for many businesses. For smaller companies, even brief outages disrupt workflows, stall revenue, and leave employees unable to perform their jobs.

      The consequences don’t stop there. Frequent disruptions damage your reputation, frustrate customers, and erode trust—while your competitors race ahead. In a world where speed and reliability are critical, downtime doesn’t just slow your business; it threatens your ability to grow and compete.
