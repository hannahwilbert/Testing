  - title: 'Unpredictable IT Costs Are Holding Your Business Back'
    body: >
      Unplanned IT expenses aren’t just a nuisance—they’re a significant drain 
      on your budget and growth potential. Whether it’s costly repairs, sudden 
      downtime, or quick fixes that don’t solve the real issue, unpredictable IT 
      problems leave you blindsided and scrambling.
    body2: >
      Studies show that unplanned downtime can cost businesses an average of 
      $5,600 per minute, adding up to tens of thousands in lost revenue, 
      productivity, and progress. On top of that, without a clear IT strategy, 
      businesses often waste money on outdated systems, redundant tools, and 
      inefficient processes. Every unexpected IT cost pulls resources away from 
      innovation, hiring, or opportunities to scale.
    body3: >
      The bottom line: <em>Unpredictable IT expenses create uncertainty, stress, and missed opportunities for growth.</em>
