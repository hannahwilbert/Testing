      In today’s digital age, cybersecurity threats are no longer a possibility—they’re an inevitability. Every business, regardless of size or industry, is a target. From ransomware attacks that paralyze operations to phishing schemes that compromise sensitive data, the consequences are real and devastating. A single breach can cost your company not only thousands—or millions—of dollars but also its reputation and customer trust.

      <p>The numbers tell a chilling story:</p>
      <ul class="pl-8 space-y-4 text-sm font-light list-disc list-outside md:text-base">
      <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">95% increase in ransomware attacks:</strong> In 2023 alone, with global damages exceeding $20 billion annually.</li>
      <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">43% of cyberattacks:</strong> Target small businesses, but only 14% are prepared to defend themselves.</li>
      <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">High-profile breaches:</strong> Disrupted operations for weeks and resulted in multi-million dollar losses.</li>
      </ul>
    body3: >
      Why does this matter to you? Because your organization holds valuable data—financial records, client information, intellectual property—that cybercriminals actively seek to exploit. Without robust protection, you risk being the next headline. The threat landscape is constantly evolving, with attackers becoming smarter, faster, and more destructive.
