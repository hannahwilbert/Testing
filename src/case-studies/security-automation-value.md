challenge:
  - title: 'Manual Processes Drive Up Breach Costs'
    body: |
      Organisations without robust automation rely on manual investigations that slow detection and containment. Analysts copy data between tools, alerts stack up, and attacks escalate. With threat volume growing, human effort alone can’t keep up—leading to higher breach costs, operational strain, and greater regulatory risk.

solution:
  - title: 'Security AI + Automation Accelerate Response'
    body: |
      Elevate helps teams deploy automation strategically:
      <ul class="pl-8 space-y-4 text-sm font-light list-disc list-outside md:text-base">
        <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">AI-driven monitoring:</strong> Identify anomalies in real time across endpoints, identity, and network telemetry.</li>
        <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">Automated containment:</strong> Stop attacks before they escalate with policy-driven isolation and remediation.</li>
        <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">Orchestrated playbooks:</strong> Integrate automation with incident response to accelerate recovery.</li>
      </ul>

        <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">$2.2M savings:</strong> Companies that extensively deploy security AI and automation tools saw <strong>$2.2 million lower</strong> average breach costs.</li>
        <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">Faster response:</strong> Automation reduces disruptions and the risk of regulatory penalties.</li>
        <li class="text-sm"><strong class="font-semibold">Higher-value focus:</strong> IT staff spend more time on strategy and resilience planning.</li>

future:
  - title: 'Automation as a Long-Term Advantage'
    body: |
      As attackers adopt more sophisticated methods, automation will continue to deliver cost savings and resilience. Organisations that embed AI-driven monitoring and automated response deep into their security operations strengthen long-term protection and agility.
