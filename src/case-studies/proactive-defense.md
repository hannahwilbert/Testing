  - title: 'The Customer'
    body: |
      Valley Trust Credit Union serves more than 95,000 members across the Southwest. A lean IT group supports online banking, payments, and in-branch systems while managing regulatory requirements for a growing, digitally focused membership.

challenge:
  - title: 'Long Dwell Times Threatened Member Trust'
    body: |
      Despite solid perimeter controls, Valley Trust’s incident reviews revealed intrusions living inside the network for months. When breaches took longer than 200 days to identify and contain, recovery costs and member disruption surged. The team needed a partner to shorten dwell time, standardise response, and protect regulated data without expanding headcount.

      “We couldn’t afford multi-month dwell times. We needed proactive visibility and a SOC that would jump on signals immediately.” <br><em>– Draft Quote, IT Director</em>

solution:
  - title: 'L3 Networks MDR Delivered Continuous Vigilance'
    body: |
      L3 Networks deployed Managed Detection & Response with 24/7 SOC coverage. Endpoint detection & response, identity telemetry, and network logs now stream into a single platform. Threat-hunting playbooks, automated containment for privileged accounts, and rehearsed incident runbooks aligned IT, risk, and executive teams.
