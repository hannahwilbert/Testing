faqCategories:
  - name: General Overview
    items:
      - question: What is All Desk AI?
        answer: All Desk AI is a fully staffed 24/7 helpdesk service powered by proprietary AI. It combines intelligent automation with real human support to provide fast, reliable, and personalized IT assistance around the clock.

      - question: How is this different from traditional IT helpdesk services?
        answer: Unlike traditional helpdesks, All Desk AI uses AI to triage tickets, suggest solutions, write notes, track sentiment, and detect recurring issues. This leads to faster resolutions, less back-and-forth, and a more consistent user experience—without sacrificing the personal touch.

      - question: Is support really available 24/7?
        answer: Yes. Your users can get support anytime—day or night. Our U.S.-based team is always online, ready to assist, and backed by our intelligent AI systems that continuously optimize the support process.

  - name: Technical & Operational
    items:
      - question: What reporting and analytics are available to IT managers?
        answer: All Desk AI provides IT managers with real-time dashboards and scheduled reports covering ticket trends, sentiment analysis, resolution times, recurring issues, and team performance—giving you full visibility into support quality and efficiency.

      - question: Does it work with co-managed IT environments?
        answer: Absolutely. All Desk AI is built to support co-managed models. You can retain internal IT staff while our team handles the day-to-day tickets or after-hours support—whichever suits your needs best.

      - question: What if the AI can’t solve the issue?
        answer: If the AI can't resolve the issue during triage, it automatically escalates the ticket—with all context included—to a human technician. There’s no dead-end or bot loop. Real help is always one step away.

      - question: How do you ensure ticket quality?
        answer: Every ticket goes through an AI-driven QA process that checks for clear communication, timeliness, resolution accuracy, and customer sentiment.

      - question: How do you handle recurring issues or ticket noise?
        answer: All Desk AI continuously scans for recurring patterns across users, devices, and accounts. If an issue keeps showing up, it flags the root cause so we can stop the cycle through a fix or project recommendation.

  - name: User Experience
    items:
      - question: Will our users interact with a chatbot or a person?
        answer: Both. The AI chatbot acts as the first point of contact to gather context and suggest quick fixes. If needed, it seamlessly transitions the user to a real technician—without losing history or requiring repetition. Or you can call in right to a live helpdesk engineer.

      - question: What is the response time like?
        answer: Calls and chats are answered within minutes, ensuring immediate support for urgent issues. Ticket responses consistently meet or exceed SLA guidelines, with AI triage streamlining routine requests so our human team can focus on complex cases—minimizing wait times and maximizing user support.

      - question: Is the support experience personalized?
        answer: Yes. The AI understands the user’s history, preferences, past tickets, and device info. This ensures every interaction feels personalized, efficient, and relevant—without starting from scratch.

  - name: Implementation & Pricing
    items:
      - question: How long does onboarding take?
        answer: Most clients are fully onboarded within 30 days. We handle system setup, AI training on your environment, and integrations.

      - question: What’s included in the monthly service?
        answer: You get 24/7 helpdesk coverage, AI-powered tools, reporting, user support, co-managed team support, and access to your dedicated account manager. There are no hidden fees.

      - question: Do I get a dedicated Account Manager or Technical lead?
        answer: Yes, when you sign up you will be assigned an Account Manager and Technical Lead. They will help onboard and continue to maintain a close working relationship.

      - question: Is there a setup fee?
        answer: No. All Desk AI is designed for rapid deployment with no upfront implementation costs. Your monthly per-user rate covers all onboarding services.

      - question: Will you need to perform an assessment?
        answer: A light environment review is performed to integrate with your Active Directory or Entra ID and ensure proper user identification. No lengthy discovery process is required.

      - question: Will a client get a human agent if a ticket is not resolved during the first call/interaction?
        answer: Yes. All unresolved issues are automatically escalated to a live agent based on our SLA commitments.

      - question: Can a client escalate once a ticket is accessed by the AI Agent?
        answer: Absolutely. Users can request escalation at any point, either directly through the AI interface or via standard support channels.

      - question: Was this AI platform built in-house?
        answer: All Desk AI leverages proven enterprise-grade AI technologies integrated into a proprietary framework managed by L3 Networks. This ensures stability, compliance, and ongoing improvements without relying on experimental platforms.

      - question: Will you be providing an escalation list?
        answer: Yes. As part of onboarding, we provide a clear escalation matrix tailored to your SLA and support plan.
