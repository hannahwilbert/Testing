          site. This policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by the site editor, nor does it apply to persons that are not employees or agents of the site editor, or that are not under the site editor’s
          control. Please take time to read this site’s Terms of Use.

            <b>Collection of Data</b> Registration for an account on this site requires only a valid email address and a username that has not been chosen already. You are not required to provide any other information if you do not want to.
            Please be aware that the username you choose, the email address you provide, and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on this website intentionally (depending on
            choices you make during the registration process, or depending on the way in which the site is configured) or unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). As on many websites, the site editor may
            also automatically receive general information that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information. Information about how advertising may be served on this site (if it is indeed the site editor’s
            policy to display advertising) is set forth below. At any time, you may request to receive a copy of any personal data collected by sending an email to info@L3Networks.com.

            <b>Use of Data Data</b> may be used to customize and improve your user experience on this site. Efforts will be made to prevent your data from being made available to third parties unless (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy
            Policy; (ii) your consent is obtained, such as when you choose to opt-in or opt-out for the sharing of data; (iii) a service provided on our site requires interaction with a third party, or is provided by a third party, such as an
            application service provider; (iv) pursuant to legal action or law enforcement; (v) it is found that your use of this site violates the site editor’s policy, terms of service, or other usage guidelines, or if it is deemed
            reasonably necessary by the site editor to protect the site editor’s legal rights and/or property; or (vi) this site is purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will be able to use the data in the same manner as
            set forth in this policy. In the event you choose to use links displayed on this website to visit other websites, you are advised to read the privacy policies published on those sites.
